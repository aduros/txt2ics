# txt2ics

`txt2ics` is a tool for converting free-form text into an .ics/.ical calendar using OpenAI.

The main goal of this project is to allow me to keep my calendar in [plain text](https://aduros.com/blog/returning-to-text/) while still getting the benefits of an actual calendar (notifications, syncing to devices, etc).

There are projects like [markwhen](https://markwhen.com/) for this which look amazing, but I'm too lazy to learn and stick to the syntax. I just want to jot wobbly human text into a file and have it show up on my calendar.

## Features

- Extract events from your calendar.txt with basic info like names, start time, end time
- Also includes any useful metadata to events like location, description, and emoji icon
- Support for recurring events
- Pretty good(?) support for multiple time zones

## Installing

1. Run `npm install -g txt2ics@latest` to install.
2. Make sure you have an `$OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable which you can [generate
here](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).

## Usage

```shell
txt2ics calendar.md -o calendar.ics
```

To see all options, run `txt2ics --help`.

For ideas of what is supported, check out the [test cases](./test). My own personal calendar is currently structured similar to [agenda.test.md](./test/agenda.test.md), but different formats should also work fine.

For Google Calendar users, upload the .ics to your web server (give it a password-like filename and keep the URL a secret) and [add using the URL here](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/r/settings/addbyurl).

## Disclaimers

It's GPT, so it may fall apart in mysterious ways at any moment. This includes hallucinated events,  events at wrong times, and **missed events**. So far it seems to work well for my day-to-day casual use... but don't rely on tools like this if your life and livelihood are on the line.

It also send your text calendar to OpenAI, so please consider the privacy implications of that.
